# VeloShift — 3D Printable Cycling Accessories

![VeloShift Banner](images/banner.png)

## The Story

VeloShift was a small passion project born out of a love for indoor cycling and 3D printing. The original idea was to build a brand around beautifully designed, 3D-printed topographic route maps of iconic [Zwift](https://www.zwift.com/) courses — the kind of thing you'd frame and hang in your pain cave.

Alongside the maps, a small lineup of practical 3D-printed accessories for indoor cycling setups was designed: wheel blocks, tablet stands, AirTag holders, and more.

Everything was designed, prototyped, photographed, and ready to go. But then Zwift said no — their brand and route data couldn't be used commercially. Without that permission, the core product line couldn't move forward, and the project was shelved.

Rather than let all the work disappear, everything is published here for free. Download the STL files, print them yourself, and enjoy.

## Design & CAD

Every part in this repo was designed from scratch in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) — fully parametric, no proprietary software needed. The workflow went from idea to sketch to solid model to slicing and printing, all iterated on a home FDM printer until each design felt right.

If you want to modify the models, the original `.FCStd` source files live in the [Veloshift 2.0 archive](https://github.com/dotsystemsdevs).

## General Printing Tips

- A 0.4 mm nozzle is recommended for all prints.
- PETG is preferred for parts that need durability (AirTag holder, wheel block). PLA+ works fine for the tablet stand.
